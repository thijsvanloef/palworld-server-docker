> [!TIP]
> Unsure how to get started? Check out the [this guide I wrote!](https://tice.tips/containerization/palworld-server-docker/)  

This is a Docker container to help you get started with hosting your own [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/) dedicated server.

This Docker container has been tested and will work on both Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) and Windows 10.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the moment, Xbox Gamepass/Xbox Console players will not be able to join a dedicated server.
>
> They will need to join players using the invite code and are limited to sessions of 4 players max.

## How to use

Keep in mind that you'll need to change the [environment variables](##Environment-variables).

### Docker Compose

This repository includes an example [docker-compose.yml](example/docker-compose.yml) file you can use to setup your server.

```yml
services:
   palworld:
      image: thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker:latest
      restart: unless-stopped
      container_name: palworld-server
      ports:
        - 8211:8211/udp
        - 27015:27015/udp
      environment:
         - PUID=1000
         - PGID=1000
         - PORT=8211 # Optional but recommended
         - PLAYERS=16 # Optional but recommended
         - MULTITHREADING=true
         - RCON_ENABLED=true
         - RCON_PORT=25575
         - ADMIN_PASSWORD="adminPasswordHere"
         - COMMUNITY=false  # Enable this if you want your server to show up in the community servers tab, USE WITH SERVER_PASSWORD!
         # Enable the environment variables below if you have COMMUNITY=true
         # - SERVER_PASSWORD="worldofpals"
         # - SERVER_NAME="World of Pals"
      volumes:
         - ./palworld:/palworld/
```

### Docker Run

Change every <> to your own configuration

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name palworld-server \
    -p 8211:8211/udp \
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -v ./<palworld-folder>:/palworld/ \
    -e PLAYERS=16 \
    -e PORT=8211 \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e COMMUNITY=false \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker

```

### Deploy on Sealos

[Sealos](https://github.com/labring/sealos) is a cloud operating system distribution based on the Kubernetes kernel. It enables the initialization of all application dependencies, including the database, with a single click.

### Environment variables

You can use the following values to change the settings of the server on boot.
It is highly recommended you set the following environment values before starting the server:

* PLAYERS
* PORT
* PUID
* PGID

### Game Ports

| Port  | Info             |
|-------|------------------|
| 8211  | Game Port (UDP)  |
| 27015 | Query Port (UDP) |
| 25575 | RCON Port (TCP)  |

## Using RCON

RCON is enabled by default for the palworld-server-docker image.
Opening the RCON cli is quite easy:

```bash
docker exec -it palworld-server rcon-cli
```

This will open a CLI that use can use to write commands to the Palworld Server.

## Editing Server Settings

When the server starts, a `PalWorldSettings.ini` file will be created in the following location: `<mount_folder>/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`

Any changes made there will be applied to the Server on next boot.

Please keep in mind that the ENV variables will always overwrite the changes made to `PalWorldSettings.ini`.

> [!TIP]
> If the `<mount_folder>/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` is empty, delete the file and restart the server, a new file with content will be created.
